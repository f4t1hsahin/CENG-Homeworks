I have provided graphs for training loss, accuracy and confusion matrix in the report pdf.
The saved values for graphs directory contains values for each training in 'mat' files. losses, acccuracies and confusion_matrices directories contains the images from plotting the respective graph.

Also, I tried dropout, batch normalization layers, and leaky relu activations.
Bonus codes are in ExperimentSuiteBonus.py and BonusExps.py.
Graphs and values are also provided in values_for_graphs_bonus.

I also have two pdf files one of them contains graphs, results and "Brain storming questions", the other only contains for "Brain storming questions". The answers to questions are the same, its just provided for you to read easily the answers.

Also, thanks for not making me do the experiments again.
